# Revive it
Checking on air quality in Barcelona so we make it a healthier place.

## Dataset
We're using the official data from the city of Barcelona: https://opendata-ajuntament.barcelona.cat/data/en/dataset/qualitat-aire-detall-bcn
As data up to April 2019 is in a different format, we only use data from April 2019 up to the (currently) most recent data: February 2024.
